This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template. The fake API and project requirements were provided as a part of the [React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) at Udacity.
